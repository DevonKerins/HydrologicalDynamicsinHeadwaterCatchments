# HydrologicalDynamicsinHeadwaterCatchments
This repository holds data and HBV model files for the paper "Controls from Above or Below? Entangled Climate and Land Characteristics Influence on Hydrological Dynamics in Headwater Catchments"

Model files include input data and the calibrated parameters from each GAP calibration trial. With these files you can run HBV to generate the model results used for this paper. Files named and organized to be compatible with the HBV workflow.
